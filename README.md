# TheShopHub

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.5.
- To start the project make sure you have updated version of angular 16 and node.
- Then type command "npm install" or "npm install --force" if it didn't work.
- The Shop Hub app consists of login page, home page and shop page, 
I mainly used two users for admin and user to login with, because I thought I should use fakeapi for the login.

- Here is the main accounts:
(username: kevinryan / password: kev02937@) this one for admin
(username: johnd / password: m38rmF$) this one for user

- Then there is the homepage with main info and some products, then shop page with different content based on the user logged in.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
